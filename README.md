# Rashmi Carol Dsouza

👋 Hi, I'm Rashmi.

I've worked as a Compliance Officer and studied law and finance/commerce. Now I'm switching my carrer and to become a Data Engineer.

I'm done my Masters in Data Science and Project Management from HTW Berlin. I have experience working as a Data Scientist/Data Engineer at Siemens Mobility, Phoenix Couriers and Saiz GmbH.

I particularly enjoy building full stack data driven applications.

🔭 I’m working on: Developing an automated pipeline for seamless file uploads, processing, and database storage with integrated monitoring and logging. The last app I worked on, [Hypowise API](http://hypowise.de/) is a mortgage breakdown web application that helps users make smarter financial descisions.

🌱 I’m currently learning: AWS services to build scalable data pipelines.

🤔 What I want to learn next: High Performance Python.
